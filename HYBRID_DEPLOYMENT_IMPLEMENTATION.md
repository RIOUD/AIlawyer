# Hybrid Deployment Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of **Recommendation 1: Hybrid Deployment Model** for the LawyerAgent platform. The hybrid deployment system allows both local and cloud deployment options while maintaining security advantages for sensitive cases.

## Architecture Overview

The hybrid deployment system consists of three main deployment modes:

1. **Local-Only Deployment**: Current functionality with complete offline operation
2. **Hybrid Deployment**: Sensitive data local, non-sensitive data cloud
3. **Cloud-Only Deployment**: Enterprise deployment with enhanced security

## Core Components

### 1. Hybrid Deployment Manager (`hybrid_deployment.py`)

The main orchestrator that manages different deployment modes and coordinates between local and cloud components.

**Key Features:**
- Supports three deployment modes (LOCAL_ONLY, HYBRID_CLOUD, CLOUD_ONLY)
- Manages local components (ChromaDB, Ollama LLM, Security Manager)
- Manages cloud components (API Gateway, Document Sync, Collaboration)
- Provides unified interface for query processing

**Usage Example:**
```python
from hybrid_deployment import HybridDeploymentManager, DeploymentMode, SecurityContext

# Create security context for hybrid deployment
hybrid_security = SecurityContext(
    encryption_level="hybrid_quantum",
    data_residency="hybrid_split",
    audit_requirements=["local_logging", "cloud_logging"],
    compliance_frameworks=["gdpr", "belgian_privacy"],
    session_timeout=900,
    max_failed_attempts=3,
    lockout_duration=900
)

# Initialize hybrid deployment manager
manager = HybridDeploymentManager(DeploymentMode.HYBRID_CLOUD, hybrid_security)
await manager.initialize()

# Process queries
result = await manager.process_query("What are employment contract requirements?")
```

### 2. Document Classification System (`document_classifier.py`)

Intelligent document classification that determines the appropriate deployment strategy for each document based on sensitivity analysis.

**Key Features:**
- Sensitivity scoring based on content analysis
- Client preference integration
- Regulatory requirement checking
- Deployment strategy recommendations
- Secure classification storage

**Classification Process:**
1. **Content Analysis**: Scans for sensitive keywords and patterns
2. **Client Preferences**: Checks client-specific requirements
3. **Regulatory Requirements**: Validates compliance frameworks
4. **Strategy Determination**: Assigns deployment strategy
5. **Requirements Generation**: Specifies encryption and audit requirements

**Usage Example:**
```python
from document_classifier import DocumentClassifier

classifier = DocumentClassifier()

# Classify a document
result = classifier.classify_document(
    document_content="CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION...",
    metadata={
        "client_id": "high_security_clients",
        "practice_area": "litigation",
        "jurisdiction": "belgian"
    }
)

print(f"Deployment Strategy: {result.deployment_strategy.value}")
print(f"Sensitivity Score: {result.sensitivity_score:.2f}")
```

### 3. Secure Synchronization Manager (`secure_sync_manager.py`)

Manages secure synchronization between local and cloud components with end-to-end encryption and conflict resolution.

**Key Features:**
- End-to-end encryption for all data in transit
- Differential sync to minimize bandwidth usage
- Conflict resolution with audit trail
- Automatic rollback on sync failures
- Secure metadata synchronization

**Sync Strategies:**
- **Local-Only**: No synchronization (highly sensitive documents)
- **Hybrid**: Metadata sync to cloud, content stays local
- **Cloud-Eligible**: Full document sync to cloud

**Usage Example:**
```python
from secure_sync_manager import SecureSyncManager

sync_manager = SecureSyncManager(local_components, cloud_components, security_context)

# Sync document
result = await sync_manager.sync_document(
    document_id="contract_123",
    local_changes={"document_type": "contract", "file_size": 1024},
    sync_strategy="hybrid"
)

# Sync query metadata for analytics
result = await sync_manager.sync_query_metadata(
    query="What are employment requirements?",
    response="Employment contracts must include...",
    user_id="lawyer_123"
)
```

## Deployment Modes

### 1. Local-Only Deployment

    session_timeout=1800,
    max_failed_attempts=5,
    lockout_duration=1800
)

manager = HybridDeploymentManager(DeploymentMode.LOCAL_ONLY, local_security)
```

### 2. Hybrid Deployment

**Use Case**: Medium law firms, mixed sensitivity documents, collaboration needs
